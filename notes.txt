## Notes
- ArcTan and ArcTan Approx learns surprisingly well with very low learning rates. Last 50 epochs of 200 epochs with lr=1e-3 with cosine scheduler, it achieves ~60% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with ResNet34. 

## GPT2 WikiText103 Notes
- 32 batch size takes 50,566M or 50.6 GB of memory. 

** GH200 ARM with batch size 40 takes 91,993M or 91.9 GB of memory (total 97.8GB of memory) **
- [0] NVIDIA GH200 480GB | 54°C, 100 % | 91993 / 97871 MB | mkang2(91986M) 

- GELU_s needs more memory and need to do batch size = 32

- Learning Rate Warmup is necessary: start with learning rate at 0 and linearly increase it over the first ~1000 steps (or 5% of training)

- fixed lm_head.weight to be token_embeddings weight
- The projection layers must be scaled down by 1/sqrt(2 * layers)

### GPT2 Small low perplexity 
- GPT2 small on WikiText103 with ReLU activation function gets around 15.73 perplexity after 20 epochs of training. 
	- Literature's "37.5" benchmark is usually zero-shot (trained on internet and tested on wikitext)
	- BPE vs. Word-Level - Our model uses GPT-2 Tokenizer (Byte-Pair Encoding -> splits words into chunks)
		- Standard "word-level" benchmarks calculate perplexity per word. 
** 15.73 BPE perplexity is strong & valid baseline for benchmark with GPT2 Small ReLU Activation Function ** 


## Conda Environments
- torch-a100 is able to use amp, compile, and huggingface datasets, tranformers, pytorch, etc. 
- torch-gh200 is not able to use compile (


GPU Information 
- Mixed Pro6000 GPU with 16 CPU does VIT 45 s. per epoch 
- A100 GPU with 4 CPU does VIT 88 s. per epoch 

- How much can we max out the speed for this?? 
- Pro6000 GPU with Max 80 CPU
